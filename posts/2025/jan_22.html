                    <h2>Zenshu Episode 1 Thoughts Summary</h2>
                    <p>
                        Man, so right now I'm only speaking for myself but wow
                        this was a shit episode. Although, the episode did start
                        off really strong. Personally, I like anime that go into
                        the creative process and that put my hopes up for this.
                        I/We came into this anime blind,
                        <em>not even</em> knowing the genre. So basically, it
                        starts with the main character who is supposedly the
                        main artist for a new anime/movie? Either way that was a
                        refreshing start to an isekai, speaking of which...<br />
                        <em>ITS AN ISAKAI</em><br />
                        Yes so the main character gets iseka'ied into her
                        favorite anime I think (it may be a movie I forget). Now
                        look, I don't have anything against isekai, but as
                        someone in club hilariously pointed out
                        <strong
                            >The main character herself even says the show she
                            teleported into is <em>MID</em></strong
                        >. Even after that I kept an open mind but I kept
                        getting disapointed time after time. One of the things I
                        disliked was the seemingly lack of direction/vision for
                        the world she gets teleported into. For example, its
                        supposed to be this medival fantasy world that
                        <strong>I assume</strong> is supposed to be taken
                        seriously since its somewhat realistic in its portrayal,
                        but it gives you these (maybe don't know yet) important
                        characters that are just a joke. The big village elder
                        incharge looks silly and way to over the top, and what I
                        assume is a main character - since after futher
                        inspection they appear on the cover art - is a
                        "<em>soldgier</em>" unicorn stuffed animal. I'd be fine
                        with that IF it fit the tone of what was built up but
                        since those didn't fit in and appear to be a big part,
                        I'm going to have to doc major points.

                    <h2>Anime Selection Process</h2>
                    <p>
                        I think for next season (or maybe even this one, I don't
                        know yet) that the club will have to refine the way we
                        do the selection process for anime. Both that we have
                        running aren't very good. The main problem is that I
                        think we need to spend more time checking out the
                        descriptions for each we want to consider (which we
                        don't do yet), and do a vote instead of a straw pull. I
                        think this would
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Allow us to pick more fairly considering that we're
                            picking the popular vote.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Prevent fluke occurances happening in the future
                            when one not a lot of people want's gets picked.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            And the extra time alloted to researching them
                            before hand will prevent things like this where we
                            pick an anime because it looks cool only to realize
                            that its an isekai, or
                            <em
                                >- insert irrational hatred for
                                <strong>X</strong> genre/series here -</em
                            >
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Other than that I think that implementing some sort of
                        seniority for the vote would be good too, because then
                        there is less of a chance of a n00b to pick some
                        brain-dead anime or something.
